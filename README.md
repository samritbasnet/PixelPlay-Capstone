# Project Title

**PixelPlay**

## Overview

PixelPlay is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse, search, and filter a catalog of video games based on their preferences. Users can view detailed information about each game, save games to a personalized wishlist ("Pixel Shelf"), and explore both curated and dynamically fetched content using the RAWG API.

The platform includes an admin dashboard for managing internal game listings through secure CRUD operations. PixelPlay is built with clean, scalable full-stack architecture, showcasing practical, job-ready skills across frontend, backend, database, and third-party API integration.

### Problem Space

Gamers often face disjointed or overwhelming experiences when browsing video games online. Platforms typically prioritize sales over discovery, making it hard for users to track games they‚Äôre interested in.

PixelPlay solves this by:

Centralizing curated and external game data for a smoother browsing experience.

Introducing search and filtering features to help users easily find the type of games they want.

Allowing users to save favorite games to a personalized wishlist called the Pixel Shelf for future reference.

Empowering admins to manage the internal catalog seamlessly without direct database access.

### User Profile

üéÆ General Users:
Browse and explore games from both curated and external sources.

Search by title and filter games by genre or rating.

View detailed information for each game on a dedicated page.

Save favorite games to their Pixel Shelf wishlist for later.

üõ†Ô∏è Admin:
Manage internal game listings through a secure admin dashboard.

Perform full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on games stored in Supabase.

Secure access to the dashboard via JWT-based authentication.

**Special Considerations:**

- Smooth integration of external RAWG API data without exposing API Keys and handling vulnerabilities securely.
- Clean, intuitive, mobile-responsive design with modern gaming aesthetics.
